        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka (<em>Optional</em>)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups egg noodles</li>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>\
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (<em>See Cook's Note.</em>)</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
